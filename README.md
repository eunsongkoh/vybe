# Vybe üéâ

Vybe is a real-time crowd feedback system for DJs, designed to keep the energy high at student parties. It analyzes crowd movement and energy to generate a ‚ÄúVibe Score,‚Äù helping DJs select the perfect tracks to match or elevate the mood.

## Inspiration

Student life is a cycle of classes, assignments, and late-night study sessions. Parties are a chance to destress, bond, and recharge. But nothing ruins the night faster than bad music. Vybe gives DJs real-time feedback on how the crowd feels to keep the energy just right.

## What it does

Vybe analyzes crowd movement üíÉüï∫ and energy to generate a ‚ÄúVibe Score‚Äù. Using this, it recommends tracks that match or lift the mood‚Äîhelping DJs create unforgettable student parties.

*   **Backend:** Python services running on Lambda, with APIs through Amazon API Gateway.
*   **Data & Storage:** User interaction and engagement data stored in Amazon DynamoDB.
*   **Analysis:** Real-time computer vision powered by OpenCV to detect movement/facial expressions.
*   **AI Layer:** Used Groq for handling fast inference and recommendation logic.
